### Instruction: What are the symptoms of Schwannomatosis ?  ### Assistant: What are the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis? Schwannomatosis is a rare condition characterized by the formation of tumors in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS is made up of the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. The tumors are benign (noncancerous) and usually grow slowly. They may cause pain, weakness, and numbness in the affected area. The tumors may also cause problems with the function of the affected nerve. The symptoms of Schwannomatosis vary depending on the location of the tumor. The most common symptoms are: - Pain in the affected area - Weakness in the affected area - Numbness in the affected area - Loss of sensation in the affected area - Muscle weakness - Loss of coordination - Loss of reflexes - Abnormal sensations such as tingling or burning - Hearing loss - Vision loss - Abnormal sweating - Abnormal heart rate - Abnormal blood pressure - Abnormal blood sugar levels - Abnormal liver function - Abnormal kidney function - Abnormal lung function - Abnormal thyroid function - Abnormal bone density - Abnormal skin pigmentation - Abnormal hair growth - Abnormal fingernails - Abnormal toenails -

### Instruction: What are the symptoms of Schwannomatosis ?  ### Assistant: What are the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis? Schwannomatosis is a rare condition that affects the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is made up of nerves that carry messages from the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. The nerves are covered by a protective layer of tissue called the Schwann cell. Schwannomatosis is characterized by the formation of tumors that grow along the nerves. These tumors are called schwannomas. Schwannomatosis can affect any part of the body, but most tumors are found in the arms and legs. The tumors can be benign or malignant (cancerous). The symptoms of Schwannomatosis vary depending on the location of the tumor. The following are some of the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis:  - Pain or numbness in the affected area.  - Muscle weakness.  - Loss of sensation in the affected area.  - Tingling or burning sensation in the affected area.  - Difficulty walking or moving the affected limb.  - Abnormal hair growth in the affected area.  - Abnormal skin pigmentation in the affected area.  - Abnormal sweating in the affected area.  - Abnormal pupil
