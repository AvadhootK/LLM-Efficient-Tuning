Signs and symptoms of the schwannomatosis often develop during adulthood between ages 25 and 30. Affected people generally have multiple schwannomas, which are benign tumors of the nervous system. In schwannomatosis, these tumors can grow along any nerve in the body, although they are less common on the vestibular nerve (vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas). People with vestibular schwannomas, especially those with tumors affecting the vestibular nerve on both sides of the head (bilateral), may have neurofibromatosis type 2 instead. The signs and symptoms associated with schwannomatosis vary based on the size and location of the schwannomas. The most common symptom is chronic pain, which can develop as a growing schwannoma presses on nerves or surrounding tissues. Some people may develop a mass if the schwannomas is located just beneath the skin. Others can experience neurological symptoms such as numbness; tingling; and/or weakness in the fingers and toes. The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Schwannomatosis. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of the skin - Abnormality of the vertebral column - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Incomplete penetrance - Meningioma - Schwannoma - Somatic mutation - Spinal cord tumor - Variable expressivity - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.\"\"\""

    "There are different types of treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma.\n",
    "Different types of treatment are available for patients with primary central nervous\n",
    "system (CNS) lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some\n",
    "are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve\n",
    "current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical\n",
    "trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may\n",
    "become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some\n",
    "clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Surgery is not used to treat\n",
    "primary CNS lymphoma.\n",
    "Three standard treatments are used:\n",
    "Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-\n",
    "rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of\n",
    "radiation therapy: - External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send\n",
    "radiation toward the cancer. Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the brain, external\n",
    "radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called whole brain radiation therapy. - Internal\n",
    "radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are\n",
    "placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on\n",
    "whether the patient has primary CNS lymphoma and AIDS. External radiation therapy is used to\n",
    "treat primary CNS lymphoma. High-dose radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy tissue\n",
    "and cause disorders that can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, speech, reading, writing, and\n",
    "memory. Clinical trials have tested the use of chemotherapy alone or before radiation therapy to\n",
    "reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy.\n",
    "Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer\n",
    "cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by\n",
    "mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells\n",
    "throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the\n",
    "cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the\n",
    "drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the\n",
    "chemotherapy is given depends on where the tumor is in the CNS or eye. Primary CNS lymphoma\n",
    "may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy and/or intraventricular\n",
    "chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the ventricles (fluid -filled cavities) of the\n",
    "brain. If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the\n",
    "vitreous humor (jelly-like substance) inside the eye. A network of blood vessels and tissue, called\n",
    "the blood-brain barrier, protects the brain from harmful substances. This barrier can also keep\n",
    "anticancer drugs from reaching the brain. In order to treat CNS lymphoma, certain drugs may be\n",
    "used to make openings between cells in the blood-brain barrier. This is called blood-brain barrier\n",
    "disruption. Anticancer drugs infused into the bloodstream may then reach the brain. Steroid\n",
    "therapy Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory\n",
    "and used as drugs. Glucocorticoids are steroid drugs that have an anticancer effect in lymphomas.\n",
    "New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It\n",
    "may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from\n",
    "the NCI website. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant High-dose chemotherapy\n",
    "with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -\n",
    "forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from\n",
    "the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the\n",
    "chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through\n",
    "an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body&#39;s blood cells. Targeted\n",
    "therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack\n",
    "cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or\n",
    "radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in\n",
    "the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that\n",
    "uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies\n",
    "can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The\n",
    "antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from\n",
    "spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs,\n",
    "toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody\n",
    "used to treat newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS.\n",
    "Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.\n",
    "For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice.\n",
    "Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new\n",
    "cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment. Many of today&#39;s\n",
    "standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical\n",
    "trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients\n",
    "who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even\n",
    "when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions\n",
    "and help move research forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.\n",
    "Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other\n",
    "trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials\n",
    "that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer\n",
