### Instruction: What are the symptoms of Schwannomatosis ?  ### Assistant: What are the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis? Schwannomatosis is a rare condition that affects the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system includes the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system controls movement, sensation, and organ function. Schwannomatosis is characterized by the formation of tumors on the peripheral nerves. These tumors are called schwannomas. Schwannomatosis can affect any nerve in the body, but it most commonly affects the nerves that control movement and sensation. The tumors can cause pain, weakness, and loss of sensation in the affected area. Schwannomatosis can also affect the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Autonomic nervous system involvement can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and digestive problems. Schwannomatosis is a rare condition, and its exact cause is unknown. However, it is believed to be related to a genetic mutation that affects the Schwann cells, which are the cells that form the tumors. Schwannomatosis is more common in males than females, and it is often diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The symptoms
