### Instruction: What are the symptoms of Schwannomatosis ?  ### Assistant: Key Points
                - Schwannomatosis is a rare condition that causes tumors to form in the skin, nerves, and other tissues.
                - The tumors are usually benign (noncancerous).
                - The tumors can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area.
                - The symptoms of Schwannomatosis vary depending on the location and size of the tumors.
                - The symptoms of Schwannomatosis can be similar to those of other conditions, such as multiple myeloma.
                - The symptoms of Schwannomatosis can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
                - The prognosis for Schwannomatosis is generally good, with most patients living for many years after diagnosis.
                - The National Cancer Institute has information about the treatment of Schwannomatosis.

### Instruction: What are the symptoms of Schwannomatosis ?  ### Assistant: What are the signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis? Schwannomatosis is a rare condition that affects the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system includes the nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body. The peripheral nervous system controls movement, sensation, and organ function. Schwannomatosis is characterized by the formation of tumors on the peripheral nerves. These tumors are called schwannomas. Schwannomatosis can affect any nerve in the body, but it most commonly affects the nerves that control movement and sensation. The tumors can cause pain, weakness, and loss of sensation in the affected area. Schwannomatosis can also affect the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. Autonomic nervous system involvement can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and digestive problems. Schwannomatosis is a rare condition, and its exact cause is unknown. However, it is believed to be related to a genetic mutation that affects the Schwann cells, which are the cells that form the tumors. Schwannomatosis is more common in males than females, and it is often diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The symptoms

Schwannomatosis is a rare disease that affects the nerves and skin. The signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis vary from person to person. They depend on which nerves are affected and how much nerve tissue is destroyed.
                
The most common signs and symptoms of Schwannomatosis are:
                
Muscle weakness and pain

Schwannomatosis is a rare condition that affects the nerves and the skin. The symptoms of Schwannomatosis can vary from person to person. Some people have only a few symptoms, while others have many.
                
The most common symptoms of Schwannomatosis are:
                
- Pain in the arms, legs, or trunk
- Muscle weakness
- Numbness or tingling
- Abnormal sensations
                
Other symptoms of Schwannomatosis include:
                
- Abnormal hair growth
- Abnormal fingernails
- Abnormal skin pigmentation
                
Some people with Schwannomatosis have a condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a genetic condition that causes tumors to grow on the nerves. These tumors are called neurofibromas. Neurofibromas can cause pain, numbness, and tingling. They can also cause problems with the way the body grows.
                
People with NF1 may also have other symptoms, such as:
                
- Learning disabilities
- Vision problems
                
- Hearing loss
                
- Abnormally shaped fingers and toes
